Title: Plotting KDEs and MDS maps of geochronology and geochemistry data
Version: 0.2-3

Description: This package provides helper functions to facilitate plotting kernel density estimates (KDEs) of geochronological data, and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) maps of these and other data. Plotting makes heavy use of the package ggplot2, the produced plot objects can be used and modified with ggplot's functions.
